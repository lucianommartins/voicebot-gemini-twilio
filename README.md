# Call Gemini: Generative AI Phone Calling

Wouldn't it be neat if you could build an app that allowed you to chat with Google Gemini on the phone?

Twilio gives you a superpower called [Media Streams](https://twilio.com/media-streams). Media Streams provides a Websocket connection to both sides of a phone call. You can get audio streamed to you, process it, and send audio back.

This app serves as a demo exploring two services:
- [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/tts/) for Speech to Text and Text to Speech
- [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini) for for responses generation using Google Gemini API

These service combine to create a voice application that is remarkably better at transcribing, understanding, and speaking than traditional IVR systems.

Features:
- üèÅ Returns responses with low latency, typically 1 second by utilizing streaming.
- ‚ùóÔ∏è Allows the user to interrupt the Google Gemini assistant and ask a different question.
- üìî Maintains chat history with Google Gemini.

## Setting up for Development

### Prerequisites
- <TBD>

If you're hosting the app locally, we also recommend using a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) so that Twilio can forward audio to your app.

### 1. Start Ngrok
Start an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) tunnel for port `3000`:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```
Ngrok will give you a unique URL, like `abc123.ngrok.io`. Copy the URL without http:// or https://. You'll need this URL in the next step.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the env variables.


### 3. Install Dependencies with NPM
Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start Your Server in Development Mode
Run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start your app using `nodemon` so that any changes to your code automatically refreshes and restarts the server.

### 5. Configure an Incoming Phone Number

Connect a phone number using the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming).

You can also use the Twilio CLI:

```bash
twilio phone-numbers:update +1[your-twilio-number] --voice-url=https://your-server.ngrok.io/incoming
```
This configuration tells Twilio to send incoming call audio to your app when someone calls your number. The app responds to the incoming call webhook with a [Stream](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream) TwiML verb that will connect an audio media stream to your websocket server.

## Testing with Jest
Repeatedly calling the app can be a time consuming way to test your tool function calls. This project contains example unit tests that can help you test your functions without relying on the Google Gemini to call them.

Simple example tests are available in the `/test` directory. To run them, simply run `npm run test`.

## Deploy via Fly.io
Fly.io is a hosting service similar to Heroku that simplifies the deployment process. Given Twilio Media Streams are sent and received from us-east-1, it's recommended to choose Fly's Ashburn, VA (IAD) region.

> Deploying to Fly.io is not required to try the app, but can be helpful if your home internet speed is variable.

Modify the app name `fly.toml` to be a unique value (this must be globally unique).

Deploy the app using the Fly.io CLI:
```bash
fly launch

fly deploy
```

Import your secrets from your .env file to your deployed app:
```bash
fly secrets import < .env
```
